Neven Mrgan (creator of The Incident and Space Age, both excellent) [has a new game coming soon called Stagehand](http://www.stagehandgame.com/). It's a reverse platformer, where you control the platforms instead of the character. It looks great, and Cabel Sasser did the soundtrack. Neven and Cabel make a fantastic team when it comes to awesome games.
