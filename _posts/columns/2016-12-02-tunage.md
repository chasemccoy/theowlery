Music is my biggest obsession, and I thought it would be a fun idea to round up some things that I have been jamming to recently. Some of these albums are new, some are not-so-new, but they are all great. I’ve included Spotify links to all of them. Enjoy!

1. **[The Rolling Stones: Blue & Lonesome](https://open.spotify.com/album/43TJjpNBfw0qY6E87VeIxX)**    
Just released today, this album features Mick and the crew covering classing blues songs. If you’re into blues, check this out for sure. 
2. **[The Hamilton Mixtape](https://open.spotify.com/album/5AgsHUKFxr5DApRCmulIqJ)**    
Another one that just dropped, this features songs from the popular musical covered by popular artists. There are even a few demos by Lin-Manuel Miranda that didn’t make it into the show. 
3. **[OneRepublic: Oh My My](https://open.spotify.com/album/30Ni9qg2MBeeZXybsMOQ7m)**    
OneRepublic’s latest album is their best one yet, in my humble opinion. 
4. **[Jon Bellion: The Human Condition](https://open.spotify.com/album/2jJReDZqTuAxr4R0ItimZc)**   
Jon Bellion is more talented than anyone has any right to be. His music combines hip-hop, R&B, and indie rock in a beautiful way. If you listen to one thing from this list, it should be this. 
5. **[Bruno Mars: 24K Magic](https://open.spotify.com/album/4PgleR09JVnm3zY1fW3XBA)**   
If Michael Jackson was the King of Pop, Bruno Mars is most definitely the heir to the throne. 
6. **[Young the Giant: Home of the Strange](https://open.spotify.com/album/3PYk8e7eo2t5CA1Y3AvhaG)**    
Young the Giant is one the best indie rock bands. Their latest album shakes things up a bit and keeps it fresh. 
7. **[Saint Motel: saintmotelevision](https://open.spotify.com/album/43URJ507cdoIRy3GJdfxjs)**    
Saint Motel is an indie pop staple, and their latest album is quite good. 

I hope you enjoy these as much as I do! [Hit me up on Twitter](https://twitter.com/chase_mccoy) and let me know what you think.
